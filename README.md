## NOTE
1. need Visual Sudio 2017 to build native C++ project.
2. ~~use 32bit node to install 32bit electron (game overlay support x64 no matter electron version), if you want to use 64bit electron, modify compile:electron script in client/package.json.~~
3. we can assocciate a new IME conext if game disabled it, but in fullscreen it will cause window to lose focus.
4. node-gyp need python2 installed on system and make sure it's added to PATH
